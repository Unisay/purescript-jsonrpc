[JSON RPC v2.0](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) client

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC):
> JSON-RPC is a remote procedure call protocol encoded in JSON. It is a very simple protocol (and very similar to XML-RPC), defining only a few data types and commands. JSON-RPC allows for notifications (data sent to the server that does not require a response) and for multiple calls to be sent to the server which may be answered out of order.
